This repository contains our implementations of commonly used algorithms and 23 design patterns.

## Algorithms
It covers the basic data structures and algorithms:
- [Circular Queue](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/algorithms/circular_queue.py);
- [Merge Sort](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/algorithms/merge_sort.py);
- [Quick Sort](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/algorithms/quick_sort.py);
- [LRU Cache](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/algorithms/lru_cache.py);

## Design Patterns
Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability. In addition, they can be categorized by their intent and divided into three groups.

### Creational Patterns
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code:
- [Singleton](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/design_patterns/singleton.cc);
- [Factory Method](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/design_patterns/factory_method.cc);
- [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/design_patterns/abstract_factory.cc);
- Builder;
- Prototype;

### Structural Patterns
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient:
- Proxy;
- Bridge;
- Decorator;
- Adaptor;
- Facade;
- Composite;
- Flyweight;

### Behavioral Patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects:
- Observer;
- Template Method;
- Strategy;
- Chain of Responsibility;
- State;
- Iterator;
- Visitor;
- Memento;
- Command;
- Interpreter;
- Mediator;
