# SDE-PREPARES
"A Software Development Engineer Prepares"

This repository contains our implementations for commonly used algorithms and 23 design patterns.

## Algorithms
It covers the basic data structures and algorithms:
- [Circular Queue](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/algorithms/circular_queue.py);
- [Merge Sort](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/algorithms/merge_sort.py);
- [Quick Sort](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/algorithms/quick_sort.py);
- [Heap Sort](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/algorithms/heap_sort.py);
- [Hash Table (Chaining)](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/algorithms/hash_table.py);
- [LRU Cache](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/algorithms/lru_cache.py);
- [Tree Traversal (Recursion)](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/algorithms/recursive_traversal.py);
- [Tree Traversal (Iteration)](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/algorithms/iterative_traversal.py);
- [Trie](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/algorithms/trie.py);
- [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/algorithms/sieve_of_eratosthenes.py);
- [Next Permutation](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/algorithms/next_permutation.py);
- [Serialize and Deserialize (Tree)](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/algorithms/codec.py);

## Design Patterns
Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability. In addition, they can be categorized by their intent and divided into three groups.

### Creational Patterns
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code:
- [Singleton](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/design_patterns/singleton.cc);
- [Factory Method](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/design_patterns/factory_method.cc);
- [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/design_patterns/abstract_factory.cc);
- [Builder](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/design_patterns/builder.cc);
- Prototype;

### Structural Patterns
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient:
- Proxy;
- Bridge;
- [Decorator](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/design_patterns/decorator.cc);
- Adaptor;
- Facade;
- Composite;
- Flyweight;

### Behavioral Patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects:
- [Observer](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/design_patterns/observer.cc);
- [Template Method](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/design_patterns/template_method.cc);
- Strategy;
- Chain of Responsibility;
- [State](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/design_patterns/state.cc);
- [Iterator](https://github.com/snlndod/SDE-PREPARES/blob/main/design_patterns/iterator.cc);
- Visitor;
- Memento;
- Command;
- Interpreter;
- Mediator;
